Throughout the conference week, they shared a house, meals, and experiences, fostering a strong sense of community. Inspired by their passion for collaboration, they decided to form a group to create a small cluster for their experiments. After the conference, these three students began working together to build a team that shared their vision and love for research and social interaction. Others from diverse backgrounds and specialties joined them, united by a single goal: to create an open cluster built and managed by anyone who wants to contribute.","author":"Lorenzo Piarulli, Simone Palmieri","date":"04 November 2024","image":"https://i.imgur.com/ttIxpCA.jpeg","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"every-hero-has-an-origin-story"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Every hero has an origin story"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"once-upon-a-time"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Once upon a time..."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Three computer science students attended a "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://hpc-summer-school-24.disi.unitn.it/","rel":["noopener","noreferer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"summer school in Trento"}]},{"type":"text","value":" to explore HPC topics in depth.
