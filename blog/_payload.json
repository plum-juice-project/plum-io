Throughout the conference week, they shared a house, meals, and experiences, fostering a strong sense of community. Inspired by their passion for collaboration, they decided to form a group to create a small cluster for their experiments. After the conference, these three students began working together to build a team that shared their vision and love for research and social interaction. Others from diverse backgrounds and specialties joined them, united by a single goal: to create an open cluster built and managed by anyone who wants to contribute.","Lorenzo Piarulli, Simone Palmieri","04 November 2024","https://i.imgur.com/ttIxpCA.jpeg",{"type":15,"children":16,"toc":160},"root",[17,25,32,51,57,62,68,82,107,113,127,144,150,155],{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":20,"children":22},"element","h1",{"id":21},"every-hero-has-an-origin-story",[23],{"type":24,"value":9},"text",{"type":18,"tag":26,"props":27,"children":29},"h2",{"id":28},"once-upon-a-time",[30],{"type":24,"value":31},"Once upon a time...",{"type":18,"tag":33,"props":34,"children":35},"p",{},[36,38,49],{"type":24,"value":37},"Three computer science students attended a ",{"type":18,"tag":39,"props":40,"children":46},"a",{"href":41,"rel":42,"target":45},"https://hpc-summer-school-24.disi.unitn.it/",[43,44],"noopener","noreferer","_blank",[47],{"type":24,"value":48},"summer school in Trento",{"type":24,"value":50}," to explore HPC topics in depth.
