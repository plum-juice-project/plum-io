Throughout the conference week, they shared a house, meals, and experiences, fostering a strong sense of community. Inspired by their passion for collaboration, they decided to form a group to create a small cluster for their experiments. After the conference, these three students began working together to build a team that shared their vision and love for research and social interaction. Others from diverse backgrounds and specialties joined them, united by a single goal: to create an open cluster built and managed by anyone who wants to contribute.","Lorenzo Piarulli, Simone Palmieri","lor3ny, sudo-err","04 November 2024","https://i.imgur.com/ttIxpCA.jpeg",{"type":15,"children":16,"toc":154},"root",[17,26,45,51,56,62,76,101,107,121,138,144,149],{"type":18,"tag":19,"props":20,"children":22},"element","h2",{"id":21},"once-upon-a-time",[23],{"type":24,"value":25},"text","Once upon a time...",{"type":18,"tag":27,"props":28,"children":29},"p",{},[30,32,43],{"type":24,"value":31},"Three computer science students attended a ",{"type":18,"tag":33,"props":34,"children":40},"a",{"href":35,"rel":36,"target":39},"https://hpc-summer-school-24.disi.unitn.it/",[37,38],"noopener","noreferer","_blank",[41],{"type":24,"value":42},"summer school in Trento",{"type":24,"value":44}," to explore HPC topics in depth.
