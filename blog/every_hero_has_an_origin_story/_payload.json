Throughout the conference week, they shared a house, meals, and experiences, fostering a strong sense of community. Inspired by their passion for collaboration, they decided to form a group to create a small cluster for their experiments. After the conference, these three students began working together to build a team that shared their vision and love for research and social interaction. Others from diverse backgrounds and specialties joined them, united by a single goal: to create an open cluster built and managed by anyone who wants to contribute.","Lorenzo Piarulli, Simone Palmieri","04 November 2024","https://i.imgur.com/ttIxpCA.jpeg",{"type":14,"children":15,"toc":159},"root",[16,24,31,50,56,61,67,81,106,112,126,143,149,154],{"type":17,"tag":18,"props":19,"children":21},"element","h1",{"id":20},"every-hero-has-an-origin-story",[22],{"type":23,"value":8},"text",{"type":17,"tag":25,"props":26,"children":28},"h2",{"id":27},"once-upon-a-time",[29],{"type":23,"value":30},"Once upon a time...",{"type":17,"tag":32,"props":33,"children":34},"p",{},[35,37,48],{"type":23,"value":36},"Three computer science students attended a ",{"type":17,"tag":38,"props":39,"children":45},"a",{"href":40,"rel":41,"target":44},"https://hpc-summer-school-24.disi.unitn.it/",[42,43],"noopener","noreferer","_blank",[46],{"type":23,"value":47},"summer school in Trento",{"type":23,"value":49}," to explore HPC topics in depth.
