## First things first

Howdy plummers! You _might_ have noticed that this update is not a "weekly" update: that's because we decided to keep the yap to a minimum and bring you only the juiciest information twice a month! _(We are boring nerds who don't have much exciting to say, to be honest, but I was kindly advised not to write this part. Note to self: delete later)_ So you will hear from us now and at the end of this amazing year, that will be rememberd for many important events but surely one _trumps_ all: the birth of __PlumJuice__! Without further ado, let's see what the Christmas spirit brought to the plum world this month.


## Come see us! (again)

Have you missed our presentation on November 27th, the one we talk about [here](https://plum-juice-project.github.io/plum-io/blog/weekly_update_29-11)? No worries! You can make up for it this __thursday, December 19th, at the Computer Architecture lecture at 11:00__. There will be stickers and your favourite above-average looking computer science students, don't miss!

## Santa Claus is coming to town

A shocking revelation has emerged from some recent groundbreaking work on the hottest research topics of our century: __it's Christmas time__, plummies! Our team is preparing the 97% acrylic ugly sweaters, the mistletoe and the candy canes (by the way, who even eats candy canes? Are they really food? Do kids even like them? Are the ones we see at Christmas even made of candy or do they just make them in plastic knowing that no one will buy them? Am I going crazy? Should I stop this rant and go on with the article?). One plum in particular was pervaded by the Christmas spirit and decided that the cluster could use of a little boost. I'm not revealing anything else for now, but we'll keep you updated on Saverio's shopping spree, a shopping spree that was made possible by __your donations__! Last month we told you that it was possible to donate to the project by subscribing to __[our Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/PlumJuiceTeam)__, and since we don't have to steal electricity from the neighboring building we could say the finances are doing fine. Your help is always appreciated and will give you access to __exclusive rewards__, so feel free to give a look at the Patreon if you're interested.

## This is a stressful job

Plums are getting stressed lately. Literally. Francesco wanted to benchmark the electronics of the cluster's nodes, so some __stress tests__ have been performed to ensure that consumptions and performances were as expected. Were they? You can see it for yourselves here (I have no idea).

    <figcaption>Look at all those numbers, the nodes are certainly noding!</figcaption>

## In case you missed it

If you happen to be a reader of just these periodic updates (understandable), you may have missed our latest upload __"A Journey at SC24"__, where Lorenzo talks about his amazing experience at SuperComputing 2024. You can find it [here](https://plum-juice-project.github.io/plum-io/blog/a_journey_at_sc24), go check it out if you haven't.


## Coming soon...

We have great things in store for you in the coming year, from the cluster itself becoming more and more powerful as time passes, to fresh new projects involving our favourite juicy architecture. I don't want to spoil anything for now, so __make sure to keep yourselves updated on our channels__ to be the first to know what's cooking. I'll leave you with some homework: do you know what an [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) is? Oops, I spoiled it. Stay juicy, plums.
