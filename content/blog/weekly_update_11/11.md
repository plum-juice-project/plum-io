## Weekly Update - Ernesto Juice Cluster Troubleshooting and Progress

### Cluster Issues with MPI and SLURM

The week began with the cluster seemingly ready, but issues emerged during testing with MPI and SLURM. Specifically:
- **SLURM (`srun`)**: Only ran in singleton mode without errors but failed to scale.
- **MPI (`mpirun`)**: Crashed outright, returning an error: "PSEC: munge failed to create credential: Socket communication error."

The issue was **Munge**, a tool SLURM uses for authentication across nodes. Although all nodes had it installed and shared the same `munge.key`, `mpirun` continued to fail.

#### Solution Attempts and Breakthrough

After trying several fixes, we found a relevant article by **Hossein Ghorbanfekr** on Medium, which detailed a similar setup using Raspberry Pi 4 with a Pi 3 as master: he compiled SLURM, and MPI from scratch and his setup was working, however the same authentication issue persisted.

Later, a deeper research persisted by Ernesto revealed an Intel cluster userâ€™s solution:
- By setting `PMIX_MCA_psec0=native`, MPI bypassed Munge and used its default authentication. This change allowed MPI to communicate properly across nodes without the Munge authentication layer.

Testing this:
- **`PMIX_MCA_psec0=munge`** with `srun -n 16 hostname` worked.
- **`mpirun`** still faced issues, which we plan to address when we have more time, as the current priority is communication stability.

### Hardware Upgrade

We decided to include the previous master **Ciz0** (The only node with 8GB of RAM) in the computational nodes and passed the role of the master to **Andrea**, a Raspberry Pi 3b with 1 GB of RAM, enhancing the cluster specs:
- **28GB -> 36 GB of RAM**
- **28->32 cores**

#### Potential Problems of this approach
**Ciz0** still handles the filesystem... This might be a potential bottleneck when the multiple users try to use the server at the same time since it has more tasks to do.

The problem will be solved when the filesystem will be handled by the master 

##### So.. Saverio was satisfied now that his previously underutilized hardware was put to work! 

#### Next Steps

Using munge for the authentication will be scheduled for later, as we prioritize cluster stability for the presentation of the 13/11/24

### Big steps! Plum juice cluster presentation in the multicore class
We will present the cluster during the multicore course of professor De Sensi, each of the members has different expectations from this presentation:
- **Saverio:** I expect money
- **Ciz:** We're dumb
- **Lachi:** ehhh booh... nobody will be interested
- **Alessio:** Some people will be interested

#### Tests for the presentation
Seems like Saverio wrote and n-body simulation that scales almost linearly, at least until we are on one switch

### Behind the scenes:

**Ciz:**  
> Ok ora slurm parte! 

> Ah no, scherzavo... non riesce a trovare il node name. Perfetto, partiamo bene.

> Ragazzi, il file di configurazione Ã¨ pieno di errori... ma veramente una roba imbarazzante.

---

**Saverio:**  
> Ehm... forse perchÃ© stai runnando dal master? Tipo, solo unâ€™idea.

---

**Ciz:**  
> Ma perchÃ© il povero ciz0 non ha slurm installato? Ãˆ discriminazione, questa!

> Va bene, basta che lo aggiungo al playbook, giusto?

> Aspetta, quindi non c'Ã¨ proprio installato. Ottimo.

---

**Ernesto:**  
> In effetti, se non câ€™Ã¨ munge, slurm non ti saluta neanche. Ãˆ tipo un codice dâ€™onore.

---

**Ciz:**  
> Ok, riassunto: cambiata la password del master, rimosso TaskAffinity dai config perchÃ© tanto dava errore. Non chiedetemi perchÃ© Ã¨ nelle docs, ma non funziona. 

> Poi, aggiunto il node name, adesso slurmd parte su tutti i nodi! ðŸŽ‰

> Ah, perÃ² slurmctld non parte perchÃ© non riesce a creare /var/spool/slurmctld. Ovviamente non ha i permessi... Non funziona un cazzo, aiutatemi.

**Simone:**  
> Situazione attuale: Ciz e Ernesto disperati tra wifi e slurm. La parola d'ordine Ã¨ *reset totale*.
