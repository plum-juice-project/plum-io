## We presented the cluster to students!

This week was mainly focused on the class presentation we did on wednesday, so this one will be a lighter update with less HPC news and more... juice (I don't even know).

First of all, our biggest thank you goes to professor __Daniele De Sensi__ that allowed us to talk at his lecture on Multicore Programming.

We were able to talk about the genesis, current state and future developments of the project, and a huge thanks goes to the __students__ that were really passionate about the plum! Or maybe they just wanted __stickers__. But I get it, they're amazing.

Another lucky event took place at the presentation, but you'll have to check [our Instagram](https://instagram.com/plumjuiceteam) for that (that's what we call a _"call to action"_, you nerds).

## Our amazing woodwork

You've already seen it empty in the previous weekly update, but if you were at the live presentation you had a glance of the immense computational power we assembled. It would be cruel to keep this magnificent view to ourselves, so here it is: __the wooden rack__.

## We've got 99 problems and topology is one (but not for long)

If you're one of our beloved early plums you know that the __cluster's topology__ is one of the main topics we spend time working on. At its current state it's not optimal, as some network congestion is possible due to the type of switches we use now and the DHCP state. It is not a problem for now, since the workload is light, but it may be in the near future. Luckily, a solution is in the air and it involves some _soldering_, so if you happen to smell something burning don't worry it's us (or you're having a stroke).


## Ernesto's challenge of the week

The world's best SysAdmin never rests, and this week he found another worthy opponent: __Docker swarm__. Will he win? Will this new test get the better of him? Stay tuned to find out...
